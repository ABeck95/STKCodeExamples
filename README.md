Welcome to the STKCodeExamples repository, where we share code examples from our favorite utilities and demos for Systems Tool Kit (STK), a commercial software application from AGI, an Ansys company.

The repository offers fully functional tools and libraries of example code that you can refactor to fit your needs. It does not contain the STK application; you must obtain STK from [AGI's website](https://support.agi.com/downloads/3/ "AGI's Downloads")
