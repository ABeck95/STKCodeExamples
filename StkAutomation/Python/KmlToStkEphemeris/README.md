KmlToStkEphemeris.py
This utility will parse a KML file (.kml) from ForeFlight, FlightAware and possibly other flight log software and output an STK ephemeris file (.e). This file can be loaded into an STK scenario by inserting an aircraft object, changing the propagator to "StkExternal" and specifying the filepath to the ephemeris file.
