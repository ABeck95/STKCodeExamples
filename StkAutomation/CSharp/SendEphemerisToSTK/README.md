# Send To STK

This utility will allow you to add a new option to your Windows right-click > Send To menu for you to send files directly to STK.

This was originally designed to send Satellite Ephemeris files to STK (by the ComSpOC Operators) but has been expanded to include TLE and TCE files.

Recent updates have been added to now include GPX files imported as waypoints on a ground vehicle.  This utility can continue to be extended with additional file types/extensions.

## How to Install and Use

* Build the project to create the executable
* Move the built executable "SendEphemerisToSTK.exe" to a permanent location of your choice
* Place a shortcut to that executable here: %AppData%/Microsoft/Windows/SendTo
* Rename that shortcut "STK"
* Right click on any Ephemeris File and on the Send To menu you will see an STK option.
