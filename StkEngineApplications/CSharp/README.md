## STK Engine (C#)

STK Engine programs using C#.

### [OrbitSwitcher](OrbitSwitcher)
An STK Engine 'No Graphics' utility using C# scripting. This project is meant to serve as a companion utility to help users convert their satellite's Cartesian coordinates in a fixed frame to Keplerian elements in an intertial frame. This function does not use a satellite object but instead utilizes the conversion utility within STK Engine. The Keplerian elements you would like to return can be specified by changing the enum values near the top of the Main function. The results are printed to the command line.

### [StkMetaDataExtractor](StkMetaDataExtractor)
A short STK Engine 'No Graphics' example using the Kotlin programming language. Since Kotlin is designed for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), STK Engine libraries made for Java are able to be utilized in Kotlin, providing more flexibility for users looking to use Kotlin for an STK Engine instance over another language. [StkEngine.kt](StkEngine_NoGraphics_Stk12/src/stkengine/StkEngine.kt) contains STK Engine-specific functions, while the other files in this package are normal Kotlin accompaniments. The program creates simple aircraft and facility objects then computes Access between them. The resulting access data is printed to the command line.
